# Natural Language Opening Hours Parsing

## About

Using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 API to parse natural language opening hours into a structured JSON format
See `prompt.py` for the latest prompt being used

## Application

My first usage for this parser will be to add an open now filter to the Toilets4London app
