# Natural Language Opening Hours Parsing

## About

Using OpenAI's API to parse natural language opening hours into a structured JSON format

## Application

- My first usage for this parser will be to add an open now filter to the Toilets4London app :D
- Am therefore using data from https://github.com/toilets4london/Toilets4LondonAPI to validate and train the parser


## Credits

- Original OpenAI API call code, idea to use GPT3, and prompt engineering by https://github.com/neilkakkar
