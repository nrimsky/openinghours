openai tools fine_tunes.prepare_data -f <LOCAL_FILE>

You can use your file for fine-tuning:
> openai api fine_tunes.create -t "train_prepared.jsonl"

After youâ€™ve fine-tuned a model, remember that your prompt has to end with the indicator string ` -- JSON format:` for the model to start generating completions, rather than continuing with the prompt. Make sure to include `stop=["]}"]` so that the generated texts ends at the expected place.
Once your model starts training, it'll approximately take 3.95 minutes to train a `curie` model, and less for `ada` and `babbage`. Queue will approximately take half an hour per job ahead of you.
